# Vue Projects
Those are simple Vue.js codes that I've made thank's to an amazing tutorial provided by `freeCodeCamp.org`. The quiz project uses a API from `https://opentdb.com` to implement a simple quiz game, and the adopt project is a simulation of an adoption page that shows cats and dogs for adoption.

If you want to build your own specific trivia game you can visit `https://opentdb.com/api_config.php` where you can have acces to alot of different trivia API's.

To run any of this projects, you can go to the project folder and use the command line below to run the project
```
npm run serve
```

After doing this you can put can open a new tab in your browser and insert the following adress
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

And if your setup is correct, you should be able to see the project running on your browser.

Enjoy ü§ô.
