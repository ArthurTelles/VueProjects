# Vue Projects
Those are simple Vue.js codes that I've created thank's to an amazing tutorial provided by `freeCodeCamp.org`. 

### Quiz
The quiz project uses a API from `https://opentdb.com` to implement a simple quiz game.
If you want to build your own specific trivia game you can visit `https://opentdb.com/api_config.php` where you can have acces to a lot of different trivia API's.

### Adopt
The adopt project is a simulation of an adoption page that shows the information of cats and dogs that a looking for a new home, and you can also add a new animal to the page.

### Testing

To run any of this projects, you can go to the project folder and use the command line below to run the project
```

```

After doing this you can put can open a new tab in your browser and insert the following adress
```
